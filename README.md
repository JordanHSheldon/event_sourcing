# event_sourcing
My attempt at building a cloud native simple event sourcing web server.


# Issues
[] Find out how sql persists data.
[] Find out how sql is so fast at storing data
[] Find out what kind of data structures are best for loading event sourcing data into and out of.
[] Find out how to keep certain data alive so it can be accessed at anytime.
[] Find out how to encrypt/decrypt all of the data
